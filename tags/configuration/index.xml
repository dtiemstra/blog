It allows developers to separate application logic from its configuration, making it easier to manage, maintain, and deploy the application. In .NET applications, configuration is typically managed using the ConfigurationManager class, which can be used to make settings from different sources available to your application. The order in which these sources are registered is important because your application starts, it loads the configuration providers in the order they are configured.</description></item></channel></rss>
